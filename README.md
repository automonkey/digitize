# Digitizer

Storing paper documents is annoying. Even with online billing and communications there are still some things that end up being received in hardcopy. This is a web front end that allows for quickly creating digital copies of those paper docs.

Workflow is something like:

* Receive letter in post
* Use phone to take picture and archive in Dropbox
* Shred letter and recycle

## Running the app

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
